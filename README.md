Welcome to the Psychic game! 

Can you guess what letter I'm thinking of? You only get a few chances but guess correctly then you win a prize!
Ok, you don't actually win a prize but if you send me a message and ask real nice then maybe I'll buy you a fancy cookie.

This was a fun project that tested my initial skills when learning Javascript. 
Having to type out an array of every letter in the alphabet was probably the hardest part about this thing. Okay, maybe not
but it was the most tedious. Learning to slow down and tackle one task at a time was the hardest part. 

Anyway, enjoy.
